Convolutional Neural Network -
 Introduction-
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, 
assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
 ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.
The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by 
the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as 
the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.
A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. 
In other words, the network can be trained to understand the sophistication of the image better.
Importance-
The role of the ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form which is easier to process, without losing features which are critical 
for getting a good prediction. This is important when we are to design an architecture which is not only good at learning features but 
also is scalable to massive datasets.
The objective of the Convolution Operation is to extract the high-level features such as edges, from the input image.
 ConvNets need not be limited to only one Convolutional Layer. 
There are two types of results to the operation — one in which the convolved feature is reduced in dimensionality as compared to the input,
and the other in which the dimensionality is either increased or remains the same. This is done by applying Valid Padding in case of the
former, or Same Padding in the case of the latter.
When we augment the 5x5x1 image into a 6x6x1 image and then apply the 3x3x1 kernel over it, we find that the convolved matrix turns out
to be of dimensions 5x5x1. Hence the name — Same Padding.
On the other hand, if we perform the same operation without padding, we are presented with a matrix which has dimensions of the 
Kernel (3x3x1) itself — Valid Padding
Pooling Layer-
 the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational 
power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction.
There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the
image covered by the Kernel. On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image 
covered by the Kernel.
There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms
